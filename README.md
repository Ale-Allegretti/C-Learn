## C programming language 

### UniBo - Computer Engineering

### Bologna - Italy

**Contents**:

- Introduction to modern elaboration systems: brief history of informatics, introduction to the von Neumann architecture and to the modern hardware devices, basic concepts of operating systems.

- Introduction to the concept of algorithm, Turing's specific and universal machines, problems solutions and (non) computable functions, high- and low-level programming languages, syntax definition by means of EBNF grammars.

- Introduction to the C language: values, types, constants, variables, operators and expressions, pointers, arrays and strings, structures.
Structural and procedural programming in C: control instructions, functions, procedures.

- Input and output in C: I/O primitives, I/O based on the stream abstraction, access to files.

- Principles and basic methodologies for designing and developing algorithms: solving small-scale problems, iteration and recursion, programs structured in many modules in the C language.

- Runtime structure of C programs: runtime representation of programs, activation records and functions.

- Dynamic allocation of memory for scalar types, structures and array; memory managing and memory leaking issues in C.

- Ordering algorithms: Naive Sort, Bubble Sort, Insert Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

- Introduction to Abstract Data Types (ADT): type definition and operations (constructors, selectors, predicates, functions and transformators). Some fundamentals ADT: lists, queues, stacks.
